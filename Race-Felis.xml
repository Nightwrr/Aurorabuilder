			<p class="flavor">“Felis are the kindest, and most adorable stranglers I have ever met. If it were not for their love of sunbathing I fear they would have turned to conquest; and I find myself wondering if the world is worse for it”</p>

			Beauty can be found everywhere, you merely have to look for it. Mothian are typically a calm and peaceful people who enjoy a gentle way of life. </p>
			<p class="indent">
			Mothian follow a similar life cycle to the common moth except for their disproportionately long adult stage. Upon emerging from their cocoon, they innately know the language of their clan's lineage (or common). The unfamiliar may confuse a Mothian for a Sprite, but they differ in their wing shape, their long fanned antennae, all-black eyes, and a very soft short fuzzy fur over most of their skin in a mottled grey and brown color.</p>
			<h4>MOTHIAN TRADITIONS</h4>
			<p>All of the Mothian people have an innate knowledge of ancient traditions with each clan having their own unique variations. Festival dancing on the night of the full moon, extinguishing a burning candle with a bare hand as a right of passage, a dare, or a test of bravery.</p>
			<h4>MOTHIAN POLITICS</h4>
			<p>There are clans within the Mothian people that each pursue different ideals, but the clans are open and somewhat dynamic. Members of a clan may leave and join any clan at any time, although it is uncommon for this to happen. Having few predators in their native environment, they are a curious people.</p>
