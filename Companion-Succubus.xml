A Succubus urges its master to acts of evil, knowing the mortal's soul is a prize the Succubus might ultimately claim. Succubus display an unusual loyalty to their masters, and a Succubus can be quite dangerous if its master is threatened. Some such Succubus have the following trait.</p>
          <p class="indent">A Succubus can assume animal form at will, but in its natural state it resembles a red-skinned humanoid with an arrow tail, small horns, and leathery wings. It strikes while invisible, attacking with its sharp claws.</p>

          <p>The Succubus can use its action to polymorph into a beast form that resembles a rat (speed 20 ft.), a butterfly/moth (20 ft., fly 30 ft.), or a spider (20 ft., climb 20 ft.), or back into its true form. Its statistics are the same in each form, except for the speed changes noted. Any equipment it is wearing or carrying isn't transformed. It reverts to its true form if it dies.</p>
